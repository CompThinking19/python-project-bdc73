You know, one of the things this project makes me think about is the way in which trying to protect people from harmful content hurts those who have to do the protecting. I think of all the articles about those who moderate Facebook and remove horrendous videos, for example. I say this because it was very jarring to open your code file and see the slurs contained there, as I imagine it must have been hard for you to write them. I say all this as a possibility of something to include in your README for the final submission. As regards your code itself, this one function is almost there, but your for loop is not operating on the correct variable at the moment. You're also not splitting up the summary into individual words in order to be able to look at each one individually. I'd also recommend you look for ways to expand this: right now, its function feels a little thin compared to the scope of the project.
