It's hard to give comments more meaningful than the conversations we've had in person over the past few days, especially when I know that this version of the project is outdated given the additional work you've done. So I'll focus instead on your comments and on next stages based on where I know the code to be. You have good quality comments here, and your "introductory" comment to your function is exactly what it should be. Be sure to also document the function's inner workings. You also need to think carefully about how you're going to get user input: having the user type an entire plot summary into the terminal is a bit onerous. What's another way this could happen?
