Comments
The comments that are present include a good introductory comment and one for a function that does a great job at describing its role within the overall scheme of the program. There could have been further comments inside the function that described its inner workings, however.

Code Quality
The code that's present conforms to best practices we've discussed this semester. It's encapsulated within a function, and the for loops will do the job of iterating through the various words you are looking for in the descriptions.

Ambition
As I said in my previous comments, I think the overall conceit of this project is excellent and worthwhile. Your introductory comment is the start of a README, but no actual README is present, so you do lose a substantial amount of the points for this category because of that.

Aesthetics
Unfortunately, the program doesn't output anything when it's run, so this category is fairly hard to judge. From what I can tell from the code present, as I said above, I think this program's output would be useful if brought to completion.
